# CI Testing Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Automated mise Compatibility Testing
The project SHALL include a GitHub Actions workflow that validates mise integration on every push.

#### Scenario: Workflow triggers on push
- **WHEN** developer pushes commits to any branch
- **THEN** GitHub Actions triggers test-mise workflow
- **AND** workflow runs on Ubuntu runner

#### Scenario: Fresh mise installation
- **WHEN** workflow starts execution
- **THEN** workflow installs mise binary
- **AND** mise command becomes available in PATH

#### Scenario: Plugin installation from source
- **WHEN** workflow installs mise
- **THEN** workflow installs vfox-plugin-tursodb from checked-out source directory
- **AND** plugin appears in `mise plugin list` output

### Requirement: Version Discovery Validation
The workflow SHALL verify that version discovery works correctly through mise.

#### Scenario: Listing available versions
- **WHEN** plugin is installed from source
- **THEN** workflow executes `mise ls-remote tursodb`
- **AND** command returns list of available TursoDB versions
- **AND** command exits with status code 0

#### Scenario: Version list format validation
- **WHEN** `mise ls-remote tursodb` returns results
- **THEN** output contains valid semantic version numbers
- **AND** versions are in expected format (e.g., "0.2.2", not "v0.2.2")

### Requirement: Installation and Activation Testing
The workflow SHALL verify that TursoDB can be installed and activated successfully.

#### Scenario: Installing latest version
- **WHEN** version discovery succeeds
- **THEN** workflow executes `mise install tursodb@latest`
- **AND** installation completes without errors
- **AND** TursoDB binary is downloaded and extracted

#### Scenario: Activating installed version
- **WHEN** TursoDB version is installed
- **THEN** workflow executes `mise use tursodb@latest`
- **AND** turso command becomes available in PATH

#### Scenario: Binary functionality verification
- **WHEN** TursoDB is activated
- **THEN** workflow executes `turso --version`
- **AND** command displays version information
- **AND** command exits with status code 0

### Requirement: CI Performance Optimization
The workflow SHALL use caching to minimize execution time.

#### Scenario: Caching mise installation
- **WHEN** workflow runs for the first time
- **THEN** mise binary is cached in GitHub Actions cache
- **WHEN** workflow runs subsequently
- **THEN** cached mise binary is restored
- **AND** mise installation step completes faster

#### Scenario: Workflow time budget
- **WHEN** workflow executes under normal conditions
- **THEN** total execution time is less than 5 minutes
- **AND** individual steps provide progress feedback

### Requirement: CI Failure Reporting
The workflow SHALL provide clear feedback when tests fail.

#### Scenario: Step failure detection
- **WHEN** any workflow step fails
- **THEN** workflow immediately stops execution
- **AND** workflow status shows as failed
- **AND** GitHub displays error in commit status checks

#### Scenario: Debugging information on failure
- **WHEN** workflow fails
- **THEN** workflow logs contain detailed error messages
- **AND** logs show exact command that failed
- **AND** logs include relevant output for troubleshooting
